# IN-CLASS-html-css

In this session, we will be working on creating a simple HTML/CSS website. The purpose of the walk through is to learn about semantic HTML and how to target classes for styling.

[Check out this link](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp) for details on semantic HTML

- Make setup branch with `index.html, main.css, main.js` files
- Change background color of `index.html`
